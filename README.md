# CodingChallenge-5932
(The name is completely arbitrary)

A small coding challenge I worked on in January '23 for a video game company.
Time spend on it: ~3h
+ 3 hours of bug searching, because for some reason, the most important part of the code (the async node) only works on startup after a compilation. Could not figure out why in this short amount of time.

The goal was to implement a c++ async node in UE5 to detect changes in an Actor's boolean value.
Coded and tested in UE5.3
DON'T FORGET TO RECOMPILE AFTER LOADING THE PROJECT! ;)
