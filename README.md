# CodingChallenge-5932
(The name is completely arbitrary)

A small coding challenge I worked on in January '23 for a video game company.\
The goal was to implement a c++ async node in UE5 to detect changes in an Actor's boolean value.

Time spend on it: ~3h\
Plus 3 hours of bug searching, because for some reason, the most important part of the code (the async node) only works on startup after a compilation. Could not figure out why in this short amount of time.

Coded and tested in UE5.3

DON'T FORGET to recompile after project startup!\
Also, since this is unreal and it can get quite moody depending on moon phases or weather patterns or whatever, disabling live coding and deleting the intermediate-folder can fix things too ;-)\
